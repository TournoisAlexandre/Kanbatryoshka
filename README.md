# Kanbatryoshka - Nested Kanban Board Manager
*Nest is the easy-to-pronounce name*
## Description
Kanbatryoshka is a project management application based on the Kanban methodology, allowing you to create task boards organized in lists. Its distinctive feature is the ability to nest boards within tasks, creating a flexible hierarchical structure to organize your projects. (There may be other software that does the same thing, I don't know, I was frustrated by the lack of sub-task management with Trello and decided to create my own version). For now this is a POC.

## Features

### Board Management

- Navigate between different boards

### List Management

### Task Management

### Navigation

## Architecture

Kanbatryashka is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern:

### Model
- `Nest`: Main class managing all boards and business logic
- `Board`: Represents a board containing lists
- `List`: Represents a list containing tasks
- `Task`: Represents a task that can contain its own board

### View
- `BoardWidget`: Displays a board with its lists
- `ListWidget`: Displays a list with its tasks
- `TaskWidget`: Displays a task with its title and description

### Controller
- `BoardController`: Manages interactions with a board
- `ListController`: Manages interactions with a list
- `TaskController`: Manages interactions with a task

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- PySide6 (Qt graphical interface)
